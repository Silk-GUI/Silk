# Pre-release Checklist

- [ ] Make sure all included apps work
- [ ] Install globally by running `npm install -g` and run with `silk`. I usually find problems during this step.
- [ ] Delete ~/.silk-gui and repeat previous step.
- [ ] Check config.json to make sure it has correct default apps and window manager
- [ ] Update version in package.json and bower.json
- [ ] Update version in main.js
- [ ] Update history.md
- [ ] Publish
